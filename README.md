# Phylogrowth

Phylogrowth calculates phylogenetic growth from a phylogenetic
tree as a function of time.

For each time interval it counts the number of new subclades
and samples. The result is a historic "fingerprint" of a
specific haplogroup that allows to draw conclusions about
population growth and size.

The image shows the phylogenetic growth of the P312 haplogroup
calculated from the YFull R1b tree.
