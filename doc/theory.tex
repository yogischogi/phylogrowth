\section{Theory}

Let us assume that we have a closed population and take a
number of genetic samples. We analyse the samples and get
different genetic lineages as a result.

The number of genetic lineages is proportional to the 
total population size.

\begin{equation}
L \sim P \label{lineages-population}
\end{equation}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
L:   & number of detected lineages\\
P:   & population size
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1em}

If we detect all male lineages, for example, the population
size would be about twice as much.
