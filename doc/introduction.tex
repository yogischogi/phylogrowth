\section{Introduction}

Phylogrowth is a program that calculates population growth
from a phylogenetic tree by counting subclades and samples
for given periods of time.

Periods of human growth and prosperity are often accompanied
by strong population growth. For a society strong population
growth simply means more surviving children. If more children
survive there is also a higher chance of more mutations and
thus more new branches on the phylogenetic tree. So a high
number of new branches within a given period of time indicates
strong population growth and good times.

Population growth usually continues until resources get scarce
or the society is threatened by epidemics, natural disasters or
war. It should be possible to detect those times by looking at
the population growth.

Luckily we all carry important archeological evidence within us.
It is encoded in our genetic markers. Modern technologies like
next generation sequencing have made it possible to create highly
accurate phylogenetic trees.

Phylogrowth can utilize those trees and give us insights into
our history.
