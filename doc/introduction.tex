\section{Introduction}

Phylogrowth is a program that calculates the expansion of
a haplogroup by counting subclades and samples for given
periods of time.

Periods of human growth and prosperity are often accompanied
by strong population growth. For a society strong population
growth simply means more surviving children. If more children
survive there is also a higher chance of more mutations and
thus more new branches on the phylogenetic tree. So a high
number of new branches within a given period of time indicates
strong population growth and good times.

Population growth usually continues until resources get scarce
or the society is threatened by epidemics, natural disasters or
war. In such cases we expect that the main haplogroups of a
population would stop to grow or at least grow slower.

Given highly accurate phylogenetic trees with good time estimates
it should be possible to detect different periods of human history
and derive valuable conclusions.

Modern technologies like next generation sequencing have made
it possible to create such phylogenetic trees and to utilize
the important archeological evidence we all carry within our
DNA.

Phylogrowth uses phylogenetic trees to compute changes in
haplogroup growth. This should give us more insights into
our history.
